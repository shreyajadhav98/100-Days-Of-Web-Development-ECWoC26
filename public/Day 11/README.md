# Day 11 – Blog Website

This project is part of the **100 Days of Web Development** challenge and focuses on building a progressively enhanced blog website using **vanilla web technologies**.

The project started as a simple blog layout and was incrementally improved to include real-world features such as search, pagination, Markdown-based posts, and consistent light/dark theming across pages.

---

## ✨ Features

- Responsive blog layout using semantic HTML and modern CSS
- Dynamic blog posts rendered using JavaScript
- Search functionality to filter posts in real time
- Pagination for improved performance and readability
- Individual blog post page using URL-based routing
- Markdown support for writing rich blog content
- Light/Dark theme toggle with persistent state using `localStorage`
- Consistent UI and theming across all pages

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure
- **CSS3** – Flexbox, CSS variables, theming
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – DOM manipulation, state handling, pagination logic
- **Marked.js** – Markdown to HTML rendering (via CDN)
