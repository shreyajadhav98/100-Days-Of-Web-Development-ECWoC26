# Day 110: Shadow Quest

Run-and-jump platformer where a "shadow" replays your previous run.

How it works:
- Press `Start Game` to begin a run.
- Use arrow keys (or A/D) to move and Up/Space to jump.
- Complete the run to save your path; on the next run a ghost will replay that path.
- If you collide with your ghost, the run ends and your new path overwrites the saved shadow.
- Click `Reset` to clear the saved shadow.
